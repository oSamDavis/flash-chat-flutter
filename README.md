# Flash Chat ⚡️

## Goal

The objective of this module is to learn how to incorporate Firebase into our Flutter apps. I used Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip our app with a cloud-based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods. 


## What I created

I built a modern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat.
